## About the Project

**BudaLogin** is a login system designed to *playfully frustrate* users with unnecessary bureaucracy, tricky math captchas, and overly complex form fields.

While it‚Äôs a fun project, it was also created as a learning experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS ‚Äî practicing DOM manipulation, validation, and advanced interactivity.
